# Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)

This document outlines the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA that the frontend application aims to adhere to. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that our web content is accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some with cognitive disabilities.

WCAG 2.1 is organized around four main principles, which lay the foundation for web accessibility:

## 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### Guidelines:

-   **1.1 Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.
    -   *Example*: All images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
-   **1.2 Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media.
    -   *Example*: Captions for videos, audio descriptions.
-   **1.3 Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways (e.g., simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
    -   *Example*: Semantic HTML, proper heading structure, content reflows on different screen sizes.
-   **1.4 Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
    -   *Example*: Sufficient color contrast, ability to resize text without loss of content or functionality.

## 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### Guidelines:

-   **2.1 Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
    -   *Example*: All interactive elements can be tabbed to and activated using keyboard.
-   **2.2 Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content.
    -   *Example*: No unexpected time limits on forms or content.
-   **2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.
    -   *Example*: Avoid flashing content (especially between 2 Hz and 60 Hz).
-   **2.4 Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
    -   *Example*: Clear focus indicators, consistent navigation, skip links.
-   **2.5 Input Modalities**: Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.
    -   *Example*: Support for touch gestures, clear labels for controls.

## 3. Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

### Guidelines:

-   **3.1 Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable.
    -   *Example*: Use clear and simple language, provide definitions for unusual words.
-   **3.2 Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
    -   *Example*: Consistent navigation, elements behave as expected.
-   **3.3 Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
    -   *Example*: Clear error messages, labels for form fields, suggestions for correction.

## 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Guidelines:

-   **4.1 Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
    -   *Example*: Use valid HTML, proper ARIA attributes where necessary.

## Implementation and Testing

-   **Automated Tools**: Utilize tools like Lighthouse, Axe-core, and Pa11y for automated accessibility checks during development and CI/CD.
-   **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual accessibility testing with keyboard navigation, screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver), and various browser/device combinations.
-   **User Testing**: Involve users with disabilities in the testing process to gather real-world feedback.

## Continuous Improvement

Accessibility is an ongoing process. We commit to regularly reviewing and improving the accessibility of our platform based on user feedback, new guidelines, and best practices.
