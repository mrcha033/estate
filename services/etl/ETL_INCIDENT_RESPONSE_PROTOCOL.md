# ETL Incident Response Protocol

This document outlines the protocol for responding to and resolving incidents related to the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline. The goal is to minimize downtime, data inconsistencies, and impact on downstream systems and users.

## 1. Incident Definition

An ETL incident is any event that causes a disruption or degradation of the data pipeline, leading to:
*   Failure of one or more ETL tasks.
*   Data source unavailability or corruption.
*   Significant delays in data processing.
*   Data integrity issues (e.g., missing data, incorrect data).

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Data Engineering Team**: Responsible for monitoring, initial triage, investigation, and resolution of ETL incidents. They are the primary point of contact.
*   **On-Call Engineer**: The designated engineer from the Data Engineering Team responsible for immediate response to critical alerts.
*   **Data Analyst/Product Owner**: Informed of incidents impacting data quality or availability, and assists in assessing business impact.
*   **Stakeholders**: Key individuals or teams who rely on the ETL data and need to be informed of major incidents and their resolution.

## 3. Incident Detection

Incidents are primarily detected through:
*   **Real-time Alerts (Sentry)**: Critical errors captured by Sentry (as defined in `ETL_ALERTING_SPEC.md`) trigger immediate notifications.
*   **Daily Log Summaries**: Automated daily summaries of `etl_alerts.log` provide an overview of less critical or recurring issues.
*   **Monitoring Dashboards**: Proactive monitoring of ETL health metrics (e.g., job success rates, processing times) in Grafana/Prometheus.
*   **User Reports**: Feedback from data consumers or internal teams regarding data discrepancies or delays.

## 4. Incident Triage and Escalation

Upon detection of an ETL incident:

1.  **Initial Triage (Data Engineering Team / On-Call Engineer)**:
    *   Acknowledge the alert immediately.
    *   Assess the severity and potential impact (e.g., data loss, data staleness, user impact).
    *   Verify the alert source (e.g., Sentry issue, log entry).
    *   Check recent ETL job statuses and logs for immediate clues.

2.  **Severity Levels**:
    *   **Critical (P1)**: Major data loss, complete pipeline failure, significant impact on core business functions. **Immediate action required.**
    *   **High (P2)**: Partial pipeline failure, data delays, minor data inconsistencies impacting some reports. **Urgent action required.**
    *   **Medium (P3)**: Isolated task failures, minor data quality issues with limited impact. **Address within 24 hours.**
    *   **Low (P4)**: Informational alerts, minor warnings, no immediate impact. **Review during daily stand-up.**

3.  **Escalation Path**:
    *   **P1 Incidents**: On-Call Engineer immediately notifies the entire Data Engineering Team via dedicated communication channels (e.g., Slack @channel, PagerDuty). Data Analyst/Product Owner is informed.
    *   **P2 Incidents**: On-Call Engineer notifies the Data Engineering Team lead. Data Analyst/Product Owner is informed.
    *   **P3/P4 Incidents**: Reviewed by the Data Engineering Team during daily stand-ups or as part of regular backlog grooming.

## 5. Incident Response and Resolution

1.  **Investigation**: Identify the root cause of the incident using logs, monitoring dashboards, and code review.
2.  **Containment**: Implement immediate measures to prevent further damage (e.g., pause ETL jobs, isolate problematic data sources).
3.  **Remediation**: Apply fixes to resolve the incident (e.g., code patch, data backfill, infrastructure repair).
4.  **Verification**: Confirm that the fix has resolved the issue and the pipeline is operating normally.
5.  **Communication**: Provide regular updates to relevant stakeholders throughout the incident lifecycle.

## 6. Post-Mortem Analysis

For all P1 and P2 incidents, a post-mortem analysis will be conducted within 24-48 hours of resolution. The post-mortem will include:
*   Summary of the incident.
*   Timeline of events.
*   Root cause analysis.
*   Impact assessment.
*   Actions taken to resolve the incident.
*   Lessons learned and preventative measures to avoid recurrence.
*   Action items with owners and deadlines.

## 7. Documentation and Review

This protocol will be stored in a shared location (e.g., Confluence, GitHub Wiki) and reviewed quarterly by the Data Engineering Team to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.
